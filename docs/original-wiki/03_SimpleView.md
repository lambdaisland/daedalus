# Display debug view for your triangulations

Although triangulations are rarely used directly for display, it is useful to have some tools showing them for debug.

## Simple view

Assuming you have instanciated and populated a `DDLSMesh` object, you can use the `DDLSSimpleView` class to quickly see the resulting triangulation.

example:

```actionscript
var view:DDLSSimpleView = new DDLSSimpleView();
addChild(view.surface);

view.drawMesh(mesh);
```

A default viewport is created for you, you must add it to the display list to see the result. Then call the `drawMesh()` method every time you need to refresh the display of your triangulation.


example of a display with a maze mesh:

Constrained edges are drawn in red whereas underlying triangulation's edges are in gray.
